# FILE STRUCTURE SHOULD BE:
# lib/
#   ├── main.dart
#   ├── home_screen.dart
#   ├── about_screen.dart
#   ├── services_screen.dart
#   ├── gallery_screen.dart
#   ├── blog_screen.dart
#   ├── blog_detail_screen.dart
#   ├── shop_screen.dart
#   └── contact_screen.dart
# assets/
#   └── images/
#       ├── (all your image files)
# pubspec.yaml

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create the file structure as shown above
# 2. Place all screen files in the lib/ folder
# 3. Create an assets/images/ folder in your project root
# 4. Add all your images to the assets/images/ folder
# 5. Update pubspec.yaml with this content
# 6. Run: flutter pub get
# 7. Run: flutter run -d chrome (for web)

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If you get "Icons.twitter" error, it's already fixed (replaced with Icons.flutter_dash)
# - If you get import conflicts, make sure each screen file has a unique class name
# - If images don't load, check that image paths match your actual file names
# - For missing images, you can use placeholder images or Colors as temporary backgrounds
